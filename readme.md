# Door Management System
A simple door management system for a facility.

Please consider the following use cases:

### When I connect my client to the server –
Then I would like a list of all the doors at the facility.
### When reviewing a door within the client –
Then I would expect each door to have a customisable label to provide user friendly reference to an individual door
And I would like to know whether door is Open or Closed
And I would like to know whether door is Locked or Unlocked
### When configuring doors within the facility –
Then I would like to be able to Add a new door
And be able to remove an already existing door
### When controlling doors within the facility –
Then I would expect to be able to Open a Closed Door
And be able to Close an Open door
And be able to Lock a Closed Door
And be able to Unlock a Locked Door
